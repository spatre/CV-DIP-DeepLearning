**Implementation of Digital Image Processing Concepts**

This repository contains image processing algorithms implemented as part of my EE 569 - Introduction to Digital Image processing under Prof.Jay Kuo at USC.

**The following is the overview of the contents in the various folders.**

• Implemented Color Space Transformation, Image resizing via Bilinear Interpolation, Histogram Equalization using the transfer-function-based and cumulative-probability-based methods. Also created an Oil Painting Effect and Film Special Effect using Image Filtering.<br /><br />
• Implemented and contrasted the performance of image de-noising algorithms such as BM3D, Mean filter, Median filter and Gaussian filter. Also implemented the patch-based local PCA(Principal Component Analysis) and compared the PSNR for various parameter changes.<br /><br />
• Implemented Geometrical Warping that transforms an input square image into an output image of a disk shape. Also used Homographic transformation and Image stitching technique to create panorama consisting of multiple images.<br /><br />
• Implemented Digital Half-toning by Dithering using Fixed Thresholding, Random Thresholding, and Dithering Matrix methods. Also implemented Error diffusion with Serpentine Scanning using Floyd-Steinberg(FS), Jarvis,Judice and Ninke(JJN), and the Stucki methods.<br /> <br />
• In addition, I implemented Color Half-toning with Separable Error Diffusion and Minimum Brightness Variation Quadrants(MBVQ)-based Error Diffusion.<br /><br />
• Implemented algorithms for Morphological processing such as Shrinking, Thinning, and Skeletonizing, Texture analysis and segmentation, texture classification using Law's filter.<br /><br />
• Performed Edge Detection using Sobel detector, Zero crossing detector and also tested the performance of Structured Edge detector and Canny Edge detector. <br /><br />
• Implemented salient point descriptors and Image matching using SIFT and SURF feature extraction to develop a bag of words model for object classification. <br /><br />
• Trained and tested the performance of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) on MNIST dataset of Handwritten digits.<br /><br />
• Also implemented the application of Saak Transform to MNIST dataset and compared the results between Saak Transform and CNN. <br /><br />

**Note:** I had used Visual Studio as the primary IDE and C++ as the primary language. Have also used Python, MATLAB, OpenCV, Image J, Keras, TensorFlow frameworks etc in the projects
